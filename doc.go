// Package tbotapi provides a Go wrapper for the Telegram Messenger Bot API.
//
// Note that, if the REST API returns an error, that error will be wrapped
// in a Go error.
//
// We currently only support long polling (i.e. no webhooks).
// Feature-wise, everything up to and including the January 20 changes should
// be implemented.
//
// Examples are provided in the examples package, so check that out.
//
// The Bot API imposes certain limitations, these are especially interesting
// for inline query results and files. This library does not keep track of
// those limitations, so you'll have to perform checks yourself.
